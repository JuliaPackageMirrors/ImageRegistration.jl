# Julimaps
A set of tools for elastic image registration in Julia.

# To do
* Find triangle that a point belongs to
* Finding max of cross correlation with subpixel accuracy
* Finding eignevalue ratio for principal curvature
* Try VoronoiDelaunay for mesh generation
* Check how S&co generate their spring mesh
* Create imfuse equivalent for rendering multiple images as one
  * this could be helpful for blending https://github.com/timholy/Images.jl/blob/master/doc/overlays.md
* Finish imwarp
* Optimize incidences2triangles
